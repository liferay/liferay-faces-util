/**
 * This interface provides a contract for verifying whether or not a resource dependency is already satisfied.
 *
 * <p>Resource dependencies are added to the Faces view automatically when a {@link javax.faces.render.Renderer} is
 * annotated with @{@link ResourceDependency}. They can also be added manually by calling {@link
 * javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot#addComponentResource(FacesContext, UIComponent)} or {@link
 * javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot#addComponentResource(FacesContext, UIComponent, String)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>In some situations, resource dependencies may already be satisfied (meaning they are guaranteed to appear on the
 * page already, or are already provided as a resource with a different library name or resource name). When this
 * happens it unnecessary to render the resource. For example, Liferay Portal includes Bootstrap CSS on the page
 * automatically. It would therefore be unnecessary for <a
 * href="http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/alloy">Liferay Faces Alloy</a> or <a
 * href="http://www.bootsfaces.net/">BootsFaces</a> to render a Bootstrap CSS resource. Another example would be when a
 * developer uses BootsFaces and PrimeFaces components in the same view. Each of those component libraries add the <a
 * href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> JavaScript library as a dependency, but only one would need to be rendered.</p>
